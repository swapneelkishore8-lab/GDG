Day 1 - Exercise 2: Semantic Similarity Calculator [WORKBOOK]
==============================================================

Imagine this: You know that "king" and "queen" are related, but "king" 
and "car" are not. How does a computer understand this? The answer: 
VECTORS and COSINE SIMILARITY!

Real-world analogy:
Think of words as arrows pointing in different directions in space.
Similar words point in similar directions. We measure how "aligned" 
two arrows are to determine similarity.

What you'll learn:
✓ Vector representations of meaning
✓ Cosine similarity mathematics
✓ Why AI uses geometry to understand language

INSTRUCTIONS:
Look for TODO comments and fill in the missing code!

class SemanticSimilarity:
    """
    A similarity calculator that measures how "close" two vectors are.
    
    In real AI systems, words are converted to vectors (lists of numbers).
    Words with similar meanings have similar vectors!
    
    For example (simplified):
    - "king" might be [0.8, 0.6, 0.2, ...]
    - "queen" might be [0.7, 0.5, 0.3, ...]
    - "car" might be [0.1, 0.2, 0.9, ...]
    
    Notice how king and queen have similar numbers? That's the magic!

        Calculate cosine similarity between two vectors.
        
        📚 What is cosine similarity?
        It measures the angle between two vectors. The smaller the angle,
        the more similar they are!
        
        The formula:
        similarity = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)
        
        Where:
        - A · B is the dot product (multiply corresponding numbers and sum)
        - ||A|| is the magnitude (length) of vector A
        - ||B|| is the magnitude (length) of vector B
        
        Returns:
            float: A score between -1 and 1
                   1.0  = Identical (same direction)
                   0.5+ = Very similar
                   0.0  = Completely different (perpendicular)
                  -1.0  = Opposite
        
        Example:
            >>> sim = SemanticSimilarity()
            >>> vec_cat = [0.8, 0.6]
            >>> vec_dog = [0.7, 0.5]
